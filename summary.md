## What is covered in this course?

- Upgrading an application from Spring Boot 2.5.x to 2.7.x
- Common pitfalls and gotchas (known knowns)

**Note:** Upgrading to Spring Boot 3.x will be the focus of another course in this Learning Path.

## Why should I upgrade my Spring Boot version?

- Spring Boot 2.5.x is End of Support (EOS)
- Spring Boot 2.7 is the first official release that supports JDK 17
- It is the logical step to take before attempting to upgrade to Spring Boot 3.x
- There are deprecations that need to be addressed before any subsequent upgrade can be accomplished (e.g.Spring Boot 3.x upgrade).
- There are updates to various dependent libraries and sub-project versions along with their transitive dependencies.
- It is good practice to keep your applications up to date to mitigate security risks (CVEs) and code smells.
