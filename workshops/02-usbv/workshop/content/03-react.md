Right now, the code is in a sad state, but that's OK. You'll address these and the other items outlined in the Module 2 lessons before the end of this Module.

Your **R**eaction at this point is to just note the compile error.

Open `upgrade-notes.md` and add a new section for the upgrade at the bottom of the file:

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/upgrade-notes.md
```

```markdown
## Upgrade Spring Boot Parent Version

- Compilation error
  - deprecated method signature not found
  - Reference: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.4-Release-Notes#deprecations-in-spring-boot-24
```

That's it for now! Don't worry, this is progress.
