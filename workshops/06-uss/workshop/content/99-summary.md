In this lab you learned that Spring Security handles deprecations differently than core Spring Boot. You evaluated the impact of any deprecations along your upgrade path and took steps to prepare for the next `major` version upgrade. Good Job!

Your application still compiles, all your tests pass, and you are ready for Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6.
