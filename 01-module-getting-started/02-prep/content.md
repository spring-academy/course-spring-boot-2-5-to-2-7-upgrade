Prior to attempting any upgrade it's important to review the release notes for your current version of Spring Boot (in this case 2.5) , its predecessor minor version (2.4), the target version (2.7), and any versions in between. The release notes will familiarize you with deprecations, known issues, and what's new.

For the purposes of this course you'll definitely want to understand the deprecations for 2.4 and 2.5 because you'll need to address those in order to successfully upgrade to 2.7. The Spring Boot team will maintain deprecations for one (1) minor version only. So, 2.4 deprecations are no longer supported in 2.6, and 2.5 deprecations will no longer be supported in 2.7
